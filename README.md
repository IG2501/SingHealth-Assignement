ICU Patients Dataset

Dataset used:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ukveteran/icu-patients 

Stored in: ICU_patients/ICU.csv

Tasks Performed:
- Converting the dataset to a normalized form.
- Export the normalized tables to sqlite3
- Develop three machine learning model for predicting patient survival
         - Logistic Regression
         - Decision Tree
         - Random Forest
- Interpret the metrics of the models
- Compare between the model performance


Conclusion:
- Decision tree and Random Forest models have the best test accuracy.
- ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic - that is the ability of the model to distinguish between the two classes),of the Random Forest Model is higher than the other two   models.
- Random Forest model also has higher precision than the other two models.
